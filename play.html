        An Ideal Husband

    <h2 class="name"> An Ideal Husband </h2>
    <h3 class="name"> ACT III. _The Library of Lord Goringâ€™s House in Curzon Street_.</h3>
    <p class="stage-direction"> [_Enter_ LORD GORING in evening dress with a buttonhole.  _He is
        wearing a silk hat and Inverness cape_.  White-gloved, _he carries a
        Louis Seize cane_.  His are all the delicate fopperies of Fashion.
        One sees that he stands in immediate relation to modern life, _makes it
        indeed_, and so masters it.  _He is the first well-dressed philosopher
        in the history of thought_.]</p>
        
         <h5 class="LORDGORING"> LORD GORING.</h5> <p class="speech"> Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?</p>
        
         <h5 class="PHIPPS"> PHIPPS.</h5> <p> Yes, my lord.  <p class="stage-direction"> [Takes his hat, cane, and cape, _and
        presents new buttonhole on salver_.]</p>
        
        <h5 class="LORDGORING"> LORD GORING.</h5>  <p class="speech"> Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
        of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.</p>
        
        <h5 class="PHIPPS"> PHIPPS.</h5>  <p class="speech"> Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.</p>
        
        <h5 class="LORDGORING"> LORD GORING.</h5>   <p class="stage-direction"> [Taking out old buttonhole.]</p>  <p class="speech"> You see, Phipps, Fashion is
        what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.</p>
        
        <h5 class="PHIPPS"> PHIPPS.</h5>  <p class="speech"> Yes, my lord.</p>
        
        <h5 class="LORDGORING"> LORD GORING.</h5>  <p class="speech"> Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.</p>
        
        <h5 class="PHIPPS"> PHIPPS.</h5>  
        <p class="speech"> Yes, my lord.</p>
        <h5 class="LORDGORING"> LORD GORING.</h5> 
         <p class="stage-direction"> [Putting in a new buttonhole.]</p> 
         <p class="speech"> And falsehoods the truths of other people.</p>
